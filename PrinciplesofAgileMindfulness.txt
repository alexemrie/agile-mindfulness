   * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz : Cofounder of Reddit website. 
   * Cofounder of Reddit and his life history of trying to transform the world but went too far. Cautionary tale for becoming too attached to progress. Need to be mindful about what is actually possible and cautious to not try to change too much at once, especially with regard to established institutions of power that want to stay in power, Machiavelli. By remaining impartial and trying to implement positive social change that is unbiased one can avoid many of Aaron’s inability to overcome existing power dynamics.
